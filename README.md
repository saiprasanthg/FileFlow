This was a free mini course during few days to present the main course offered by Rocketseat. The objective of the course it was to work with Node.js, React, React Native and MongoDB. The project developed, the RocketBox, is able to send files to the server (in this case locally) but connecting to a database remotely (using the MongoD Atlas). It also has been used socket tool to sync in run time the files of the boxes.
